Selected Plan: 3
Steps:
1. Construct a powerful title utilizing the required "NextGen EV Car" phrase.
2. Begin writing with the mandatory "innovative" and "cutting-edge" lead sentence introduction.      
3. Write a sentence that strongly pairs the massive long-range battery capability with minimal range anxiety.
4. Integrate the concept of efficiency by following up immediately with the benefit of fast charging.
5. Develop a robust sentence dedicated entirely to the vehicle's comprehensive advanced safety features.
6. Add a sentence emphasizing the utility and spaciousness inherent in the Jumbo design.
7. Check the total word count frequently to guarantee adherence to the sub-200-word restriction.     
8. Proofread the entire draft for compelling marketing tone and consistency.
9. Conclude the passage smoothly with the required directional prompt to the official website jumboev.com.
Reason: Plan 3 is the superior choice because it not only meticulously covers every mandated constraint (Title, opening sentence words, required features, word count, and website reference) but also applies the strongest marketing strategy. By explicitly linking core features (long-range battery, fast charging) to immediate consumer benefits (reduced range anxiety, efficiency) early in the writing process (Steps 3 & 4), the resulting content will be highly compelling. Furthermore, Step 6 introduces contextually relevant information (utility and spaciousness, aligning with the 'Jumbo' product name) rather than abstract features, ensuring every word serves the product's identity while efficiently managing the strict sub-200-word limit.

FINAL SELECTION
============================================================
Selected Passage: 2

Reason: Passage 2 stands out due to its superior focus on consumer benefits, emotional engagement, and masterful integration of the product's primary unique selling proposition (USP) represented by the 'Jumbo' name. While all passages adhere perfectly to the structural requirements, Passage 2 uses more aspirational language ('Experience the future,' 'triumph of innovative engineering') and immediately translates technical features into user freedom and empowerment ('erasing concerns about daily commute range anxiety,' 'more time dominating the road'). Crucially, it dedicates strong copy to connecting the vehicle's name to practical utility—something essential for a 'Jumbo' car marketed towards versatile use or families. This balance of cutting-edge technology and real-world utility makes Passage 2 the most persuasive piece of marketing copy.
